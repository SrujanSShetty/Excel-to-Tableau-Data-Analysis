## 📊 Tableau Projects Completed

As part of the course and my own exploration, I built these Tableau analytical dashboards:

### **1. [Bank Performance Over Time](Bank-Performance-over-time.twb)**  
Interactive dashboard visualizing multi-year bank trends, profit/loss patterns, and summary tables from imported raw Excel data.

### **2. [2010 Had the Highest Estimated Losses](2010-had-the-highest-est-Losses.twb)**  
Drilled down using Tableau to identify years with outlier losses. 2010 uniquely stood out with record-high losses, confirmed by dynamic charts.
